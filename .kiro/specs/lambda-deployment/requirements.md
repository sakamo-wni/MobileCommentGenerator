# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature specification outlines the requirements for deploying the existing weather comment generation system to AWS Lambda with DynamoDB as the primary data storage solution. The system currently operates as a Python application with Streamlit frontend and needs to be transformed into a serverless architecture that can handle weather data processing, comment generation, and location management through AWS Lambda functions with DynamoDB for persistent storage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the weather comment generation system to AWS Lambda, so that I can achieve serverless scalability and reduce infrastructure management overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN all Lambda functions SHALL be packaged and deployed successfully to AWS
2. WHEN a deployment is triggered THEN the system SHALL include all necessary dependencies and configurations
3. WHEN Lambda functions are invoked THEN they SHALL have appropriate IAM roles and permissions to access required AWS services
4. WHEN the deployment completes THEN the system SHALL provide API endpoints accessible via API Gateway

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want weather data to be stored and retrieved from DynamoDB, so that the system can persist forecast information and historical weather data efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN weather data is received THEN the system SHALL store it in DynamoDB with appropriate partitioning
2. WHEN forecast data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from DynamoDB within acceptable latency limits
3. WHEN weather data expires THEN the system SHALL implement TTL-based cleanup automatically
4. WHEN storing weather data THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent writes without data corruption
5. WHEN querying weather data THEN the system SHALL support efficient lookups by location and date range

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want generated comments to be stored in DynamoDB, so that the system can maintain comment history and enable retrieval of past comments for similarity analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a comment is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in DynamoDB with metadata including location, date, and weather conditions
2. WHEN retrieving past comments THEN the system SHALL support efficient queries by location and date range
3. WHEN storing comments THEN the system SHALL include similarity vectors or embeddings for future matching
4. WHEN comment history grows THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate data retention policies
5. WHEN querying comments THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large result sets

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want location data to be managed in DynamoDB, so that the system can efficiently store and query location information including coordinates and regional data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN location data is accessed THEN the system SHALL retrieve it from DynamoDB with sub-second response times
2. WHEN new locations are added THEN the system SHALL store them with proper validation and indexing
3. WHEN querying locations THEN the system SHALL support both exact matches and proximity-based searches
4. WHEN location data is updated THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity with related weather and comment data
5. WHEN the system starts THEN location data SHALL be pre-populated from existing CSV files

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want to access the weather comment generation functionality through REST API endpoints, so that I can integrate the system with external applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request is made THEN the system SHALL respond through API Gateway with proper HTTP status codes
2. WHEN generating comments THEN the API SHALL accept location and date parameters and return generated comments
3. WHEN retrieving weather data THEN the API SHALL provide endpoints for current and forecast weather information
4. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return structured error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL implement proper authentication and rate limiting

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the Lambda deployment to handle the existing LLM integration, so that comment generation functionality remains intact in the serverless environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda functions execute THEN they SHALL successfully connect to configured LLM providers
2. WHEN generating comments THEN the system SHALL use the existing prompt templates and generation logic
3. WHEN LLM requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle timeouts and retries appropriately
4. WHEN LLM responses are received THEN the system SHALL validate and process them according to existing business rules
5. WHEN LLM configuration changes THEN the system SHALL support environment-based configuration updates

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to maintain backward compatibility with existing data formats, so that migration from the current system can be performed smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing data THEN the system SHALL preserve all current data structures and relationships
2. WHEN processing weather data THEN the system SHALL handle the same input formats as the current system
3. WHEN generating comments THEN the system SHALL produce outputs compatible with existing consumers
4. WHEN accessing location data THEN the system SHALL support the same location identifiers and naming conventions
5. WHEN the migration completes THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved without data loss

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging for the Lambda deployment, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda functions execute THEN they SHALL log all significant events to CloudWatch
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information including stack traces
3. WHEN performance issues arise THEN the system SHALL provide metrics for execution time and resource usage
4. WHEN system health needs monitoring THEN CloudWatch alarms SHALL be configured for critical metrics
5. WHEN debugging is required THEN logs SHALL include correlation IDs for tracing requests across services

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the DynamoDB schema to be optimized for the application's access patterns, so that queries perform efficiently and costs are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing tables THEN the system SHALL use appropriate partition keys to distribute load evenly
2. WHEN querying data THEN the system SHALL minimize the use of expensive scan operations
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL implement efficient indexing strategies for common query patterns
4. WHEN data grows THEN the system SHALL handle scaling automatically without performance degradation
5. WHEN costs need optimization THEN the system SHALL use appropriate DynamoDB capacity modes and features

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated deployment and infrastructure management, so that the system can be deployed consistently across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN Infrastructure as Code SHALL be used to define all AWS resources
2. WHEN environments change THEN the deployment process SHALL support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)
3. WHEN updates are made THEN the system SHALL support blue-green or rolling deployments
4. WHEN rollbacks are needed THEN the deployment process SHALL support quick rollback to previous versions
5. WHEN infrastructure changes THEN the system SHALL validate configurations before applying changes
